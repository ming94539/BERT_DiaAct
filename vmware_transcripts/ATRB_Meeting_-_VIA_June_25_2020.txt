Yeah guys good morning good evening everyone and today we
are going to have the 80 RB review done for
the wire project
So this project is from the CD org and below
are the details of the technical lead architect project managers
And the problem statement here is that currently we don't
have anything for a short URL and the QR code
generator kind of tool in VM Ware
And through the via project what we're trying to do
is have a common portal kind of platform created where
whoever needs can come and have short URL provision and
at the same time can have the QR codes created
for them we do have a short URL service in
VM Ware at URL dot PNG but that is going
to be deprecated soon or to answer more it will
get merged with fire in the future
So Mostly this is like for shortening the URLs and
the QR code generation at the same time this particular
platform is going to provide you the annals metric information
as to flow where all the requests are coming the
metric informations and it will have a lot of options
to have the user configured rules being configured for a
particular short URL So yeah it's just cover the short
URL and the QR code generations
It will have one admin portal kind of controls and
a list of back end service we expect the acilius
to be less than a second
So how long this tinyurl is valid
Uh it will be So those all can be defined
by the rules actually like the user wants right I
think it is a good question like they can set
the number of hits that they want this URL to
be accessible only 50 times they can even set a
rule that is URL gets expired after this particular date
So those all guns under the rules which the user
can go and configure in the portal the VR portal
Place some kind of a default so that we don't
end up clogging it with people who don't care and
submit tons of them
I Yeah you heard the question John is asking
Now how can we the one thing is John is
asking me right John is it defaults and also how
do we stop someone submitting too many requests That there's
actually two pieces 2 pieces of that but but yeah
the the big one is also I'd be kind of
curious to know what the target domains are intended to
be So the first question on what if somebody is
creating a lot and not studying exploration we don't either
way we don't plan on reusing the codes once they've
been created and even not at 5 we're converting converting
from base 10 to base 62 to generate the code
so even at 5 characters we could have
Uh I believe was over a billion uh possible codes
so um So we're not storing these per say other
than just logs in the web server
Rachel Or we I think I think I can try
to answer this party so for every everyone that's requested
right so it's the user attempts to shorten URL it
takes their URL and it places it in a database
and it generates a base 62 ID that had been
returned so and when there is a look up on
that short URL it uses that to to keanan index
in the database to retrieve the full length URL so
yes we are we are storing all that data but
each entry is a simple mapping of one long URL
to agree but Do you have a way to expire
stuff when it hits a certain date 'cause if you
just let it
If you if you offer the default of no expiration
then people will take that as the default never kill
me
Your database will fill up with stuff that's dead so
have you built in anything to detect dead ones that
you can prune or have you or what are you
considering around that
I mean since we are gathering metrics on them theoretically
we could you know see if nothing's if there's a
few that are really old and they're not getting any
clicks we could put that into the user the user
info say hey you know if your link doesn't get
X amount of clicks after this amount of time then
it will just get deleted
But they currently there's that's not implemented anywhere but we
would have the ability to see that data that actually
would be a great default you know inactive links for
30 days or automatically prove Your database would never outgrow
it till usefulness or something or maybe maybe 90 days
or something like that so you could even do a
year I mean yeah that would be as long as
you prune it that would be probably a good idea
yeah and like I said currently that's not a part
of it but that's definitely something that's when the technical
limitations at this time
And the users do have the option that the users
will see all the shortened URLs that they created when
they log into the portal so they will have the
ability to see hey these are really old and or
not use anymore I can go in and delete them
So you might even be able to make out so
it makes some like default reporting options or something to
make the hey this one was really dead floated to
the top and you know do you want to kill
this you know Nobody is accessed this index in mountain
time yeah exactly exactly exactly yeah it's sorted sorted by
popularity reverse you know and let him know hey yeah
you have something there John yeah definitely we can take
this to our product managers and he can work with
the teams to set out the expiry maybe he won't
expire he will send it after the expiry to the
person who created 2
Whether we want to extend it or not and if
that person doesn't return 30 days then maybe we expire
but here we can add those default rules in 90
days or even a year as long as you just
give it a finite length of existence it would be
just better it would be better for this overall period
I think that would be great to have like an
automatic one year expiration unless it's popular less it's active
yeah right yeah Are there any plans to integrate with
any of these tools like confluence orgera so that their
then user coming to the va.com and punching those URL
and get the TinyURL is there any easy integration with
these tools where they can click on share button it
will automatically do
Uh an option to make it any URL are there
any plans or is it a standalone service that's a
good solution banker Think of that if we do plan
on having the developer API so that we can integrate
their tools with this service as well
So under testing take advantage Yeah yeah the plan originally
was to you know this is a user end user
application for you know just available on workspace one but
obviously we're going to expose an API to be used
by other applications of VM Ware 'cause I know there's
several off the top of my head that use QR
codes and some that even use short URL shorteners so
the idea was to make this sort of the core
central service for everything short URL in QR within VM
Ware
Yeah so another question I have is on the security
aspects so many of our pages has a token sorino
URL has having a token for APIs
Will there be an issue
With our two sharing across I mean the guy whoever
sharing should be responsible for it but I know that
but
Yeah we need to see storing those tokens as part
of URL
Right so actually that's one of the things that we
view as one of the benefits of the service because
the alternative is somebody uses Bitly or some other online
URL generator that isn't secure that isn't posted on VM
ware's network and those tokens are getting stored in somebody
elses data center so that's one of the benefits of
building this internally is all of this will be secured
in a VM Ware data center yeah I used UUID
generator I used Jason formatter online I used XML formatter
yeah I use a lot of them OK
Very Yeah
I OK so this is the V architecture and pretty
much we're going to have one admin portal that will
be the VR console that would be accessible internally only
and would have the VM authentications and then we are
not trying to use vmware.com we will have the vr.bmw.com
Set up And To make the URL as short as
possible because the QR code that is generated the shorter
the URL the foster the scan is of the QR
code and it will come to the vehicle service where
it will have all the rules engine rules created and
it will give the redirect URL for the re direct
purpose you plan to have it stored in the corporate
mongo DB we're going to request a collection over there
And for faster processing we're going to have the data
put in red is cash
So yeah that's very nice can I ask what are
your plan target domains are is your rewrite domain gonna
be via via whatever VM W com that's awfully long
If I was doing it
Via.vmw.com/it will be like whatever the user provided code right
Miss they can have their own code also or it
can be an auto generated one in like 4 to
5 digits characters
How about VM www.io My very short URL
For you characters on 6 characters
Well it was if this has any run runtime here
it's going to get up to
A lot more characters than that eventually right How many
can this grow to it's not it's not limited there's
no technical limitation but we I mean in the in
the object of keeping everything as short as possible we
looked at 5 just to start and that gets us
up to like I think 500 million or so
So you're signing these things in order
A smore somewhat yes but there's more to it than
that So I guess yes there's like a you know
account in the database and that gets converted to a
base 62 format of that number and obviously you know
there's sanitation and stuff like that so that the number
system doesn't generate unsavory term or something like that but
yeah they are sort of going in order ineffective according
to the base 62 number system
So are you multi DC deployment tomorrow yeah so the
deployment would be active passive and it will be deployed
in our city org only the one caleon demo'd last
80 RB And we are going to have the CDC
as our primary and double DC's passive so the whole
setup is done for the CD platform we have both
the namespace created in both of the production clusters
And we also have a DNS setups also being done
there we are using dyna DNS and they had to
move to NS one so yeah it will be pretty
much the CD setup that is being done and all
the applications would be on those clusters
I
So it's a releases independent clusters it already is
Where is this going to be hosted internally I cedec
cluster an internal VIP why not
Is there a reason we're not looking at 10s yeah
no no no so definitely cancel I think Charlene also
asked this question in the ID RV so the first
thing what happened was that when we were publishing the
whole this setup for the CD org we went to
lynceus team to get that answers that have done actually
that was our first choice but it seems we at
the same time our VM applications were also getting migrated
and all the other applications so we had a requirement
for like around 100 CPU's 200 We ran something of
that
And that gets multiplied by all the environments dev test
and all so I think then so and the teams
are working on getting that hardware and all provisioned
And once that is being done we have over requested
cute available it will be an instance which so as
of now the applications that we are deploying is why
I see a CDC I pipelines using the GitLab ones
and we don't have any dependencies on deck as such
actually if it works on tag it should work on
time so also So once that thing is provisioned bailenson
monestime's it should be pretty much we will be moving
all over workload there but right now it is on
deck because that were very quick to give us whatever
we requested
So is there a reason why we're not using CDN
We are not using is there any reason why we're
not using any content delivery networks so that is Syrian
is used actually so we're using the Akamai CDN and
when they requested the Akamai it resolves by other GTM
for active passive one the dyna DNS
OK it's not there in the diagram that's why he
hasn't shown that slide yet no nights my bad I
have not added there
A super ticket this is a container application right yes
it's the container application
So what is your OS image
For your application for your containers OK so I think
for that we are using the bitnami Java image
That's what we will be using the bitnami version but
I'm looking forward like do we have anything
Specific to use Yeah there's a conference page from the
open source program office at VM Ware
They have pool containers OS approved it is a photo
S or Debian
He you know I think that's a good thing yeah
who am I talking to I can send you a
link yeah yeah sure Oscar definitely that's I think I
was not aware actually but we used bitnami once but
definitely please send us actually and we will replace those
Vietnamese one with the one you gave OK yeah
There are three predictions actually I'm Jay pratic Oscar like
my lot of mails are going at wrong please
OK let me let me just put it here in
the in the chat here OK cool I will get
it thank you
I So for the Akamai that you're using you are
enabling WAF
Besides a CDN right Laugh I don't get it what
is raft What application firewall
Whatever the standard rules those are there for all This
is on premise so the firewall is our web application
firewall Um
These are the crossing the pans So he's taking care
of all the tickets
Although sad Yeah I like the diagram is a little
confusing there 'cause it looks like we're going through again
to show you the how it would be actually yeah
it looks like we're going through DNS to go in
but
I know quickly actually to make it very easy
I should have used this diagram so pretty much the
architecture is in place of incapsula it is Akamai which
used the diner DNS to resolve to one of the
data centers and right now it resolves to the AC
DC-1
It hits the external Lt MFI and then the engine
exo server over there and from engine exits directly pointing
to the deck ingress controller
You should have put this in yeah Yeah
So with what villages are the parts running on the
cluster is it root
Yeah that doesn't have Arbor control now so it's root
the cube configs yeah so we might need to implement
our security context for better are back right
Yeah I want to I want I wanted to ask
yeah in regards to that was the when you do
the DMV crossing from the external IP to the internal
IP is that a cleartext crossing or is this a
encrypted cross
From external web proxy into the VMware cloud foundation like
if we stay right here let's see if so it
terminates at the internal web actually the one that is
being provided by the deck
So it is all HTTPS and it gets terminated at
the internal web so no my concern is now when
you
Enter into the network
And you go Here OK OK is this do we
have a cleartext connection when it crosses
Well I see you showing this is an NSX edge
but this is our this is crossing our Palo Alto
boundaries so the question is is when you go this
way is this a clear text or is this a
encrypted protocol coming out of the engine X proxy
So from Angie next to the if it will be
an HTTPS after that once it hit the deck ingress
that's the NSX edge internal that will be the deck
ingress here after that internally it will be HTTP so
between engine X and the NSX edge what that is
being shown it will be an HTTPS traffic excellent OK
yeah so so basically if we have the pans on
this border here which we do then everything will be
clear text in the threat prevention will be able to
protect us yeah so definitely feel internally It is it
is the same architecture everywhere in all the applications at
internal level only we get the web the HTTPS termination
I just wanted to validate thank you Yep
I
Ah
I Oh cool guys I'm just
It's also for for your
A continue environment where you
Storing your images were you getting the registry oh the
engineering Jeff log
OK the the one for marindi yeah yeah trust me
we went with harbor and all and it was really
painful and the engineering chief frog is through very much
reliable one actually Yeah So are the images they signed
I mean are they using notary for signing or images
Come on Mr good thing what I like about is
that once you have the image pushed with the label
it cannot be overridden by anyone actually
And that being signed I am not sure I can
check on that
OK yeah but that's really a good benefit with those
guys like once you load an image it cannot be
modified so I'm really sure trusted when I take those
to production that nobody can tamper with it
I So um I are using service accounts to access
to your parts
Or Like trouble troubleshooting that using SSH or how how
you service account so as I mentioned it's a cube
conflict so that's like a root access pretty much and
if you want to troubleshoot the issues mostly all the
logs goes to the centralized log inside so we troubleshoot
into the log inside hardly we need to do SSH
into the containers it's mostly like the yeah go ahead
But you have that capability so basically if you contain
is compromised you can
And have privilege to get into the house
Is that what you are I
Miss the containers can be compromised we can get into
the containers but I don't think from containers will be
able to access the host layer the VMS you talking
about the VMS underlying it right yeah yeah
I think that should not be possible actually missing we
can do as miss that's pretty much deck is providing
and every containers in whatever the namespace they have right
I just hope your deck is giving you those lines
or did the controlling all those access or you are
doing that
Yeah because the way my queue configure is right I
have just access to my namespace only
Not any other names face so they have at least
that level of restrictions OK yeah so there are various
others ways or in which an escape can happen how
even from a container to the host right or so
first thing we want to ensure here is that we
are not running it with root privileges As for the
difference in their policy right so for that to what
you need to do is kind of you need to
define a security context in your manifest so as you
are not running any other parts with higher privileges than
it's required
On top of that you also have to enable her
apartment seccomp and other other kind of security Linux security
features
OK so those are in my docker images I need
to have it run as an app user or something
to make sure it doesn't run as root right right
yeah yeah definitely will have that followed actually
With a do we have some wikis where we can
just use it if it's a standard guidelines like we
got from Oscar
I can have that like this would be standard practice
right yeah I have a conference page for this application
Let me put a yeah so we'll just use that
process in standard having the app user or whatever the
user specified created and have it run using that user
so yeah that's the one I have is more generic
like version spaces their credentials are sort of secrecy know
that car services team they are developing a meteor attack
framework for communities History is ready but you can use
what I can do is let me give you my
conference patient then you can take a look at So
by those good if TMC is used there a few
features that are provided by default or like their various
restrictions on the namespaces or pod security policies and others
but then on top of that also their future like
you know they also have a capability to run CIS
benchmark or checks right on all of the platforms but
on top of that obviously will have to do your
part when it comes to restricting the user access and
now
I I Oh God that niche
Yeah that's right you saying something about that answer right
yeah yeah
OK so yeah that's what I heard my first question
you cancel team also that the best thing they can
provide would be the hardware control which is missing in
the deck platform And we can have all the standard
practices there actually for all the projects going there
Yeah Sure
So I may get that app user armor metric from
U dot nish who members talking to sharing the confluence
link
Would be awesome Top of that if you need any
information we can always help you out with that OK
Oscar OK cool yeah yeah let me let me I'm
finding my leg and then I'll put it in there
OK no worries Oscar feel free to bring Landon
OK yeah then yeah we can skip through the infrastructure
since you already went through right here be so you
can go through the operation and maintenance
Yep Yes is it is short URL service give Al
Gore generations
The monger the backup requirement the mongo DB it's a
corporate mongo DB so they have a replication backup strategy
will be pretty much relying on that
And the service owners will be Scott Steven and Gary
from our emerging checkpoint team
Flashlight
Yep thank you Andre Thank you any other questions for
particular
Alright thank you Thank you thank you guys so much
it was really good to know a lot of things
actually
Thank you particular so we do
