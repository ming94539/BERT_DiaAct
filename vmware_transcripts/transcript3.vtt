WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.920
To the cloud around to kind of my space. Okay, cool. He did. Thanks for joining. Thanks for joining us for the folks. So before we started, just let me give the black background, actually. Okay.

2
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:20.700
So I've been working with the vendor and current that has been working with this team. They live it. Okay, in terms of defining the pipelines for

3
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.340
The Cuban it is deployment or give me

4
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.400
Till now we have been doing it manually.

5
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.710
And we created our scripts to do the deployment, but going forward.

6
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:45.000
We're in the apartment there and all the origin and all they come from an ethos org and they use the VCs, which is a VMware product for automating all the Cuban it is deployment. Right.

7
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:56.220
Now the way it is going to work is that they have created a blueprint template in which you can go and define your own pipeline like dev test to prod right

8
00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.640
And then for every environment at the Masters level. You say that for you upload the cube conflict. DAVE You getting

9
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:10.590
For the dev environment. This is my good content because coop config is like a route right now at the deck. Right. Yeah, so

10
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:20.550
And once that you configure is deployed in our deploy DMO all the names because everything is there right and coop config and namespace our one to one map right they live, you understand right

11
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.560
Everything is one to one map.

12
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:23.970
Yes. Morning.

13
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:38.580
Hey, thanks for joining. So, so now since everything is one to one map to going forward. It would be well. So we create a blueprint like dev test and prod and deploy our June Q configure those master level right

14
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.060
And after that all our pipelines will be using those two conflicts and we do the deployment. Right.

15
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:56.220
Now perimeter and team has created something more beautiful for us actually load balancer, and all gets created automatically based on the config specification. So, but when you want to share what you showed me

16
00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.460
Yeah, I can. I can. Yeah, let me

17
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.150
stop sharing

18
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.310
So first we will cover the stateless workload, right, and then we'll talk about state full later.

19
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.490
Yeah, able to see

20
00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:03.270
Okay.

21
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.040
So,

22
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.000
Which is running the country upload

23
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.310
7006. I think that was the last one running

24
00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.900
On the phone.

25
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:26.100
Here.

26
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.720
Speaking

27
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.320
On we're really proud.

28
00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.550
Beta app on. Yeah.

29
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:52.140
This is a will def enable this on the on the main node itself, but this is just some showing you

30
00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.730
Our goal is before the quarter, then

31
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.970
Yeah, that's it. I think we need to go to no goals.

32
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.520
Yeah, that's what we did on the main notice

33
00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.330
This is how we upload

34
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.660
Upload. Basically you can

35
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.570
Just start from the scratch actually

36
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.730
taught him home here, right. So if we go to the

37
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.080
So if you need to reach to this page. We just need to type this URL deploy qu

38
00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.120
Na na na na na, you don't need to deploy.

39
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:51.060
This again. Right. So you can always come from this, this will be enabled say by end of the day today. You can always come from this right

40
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.940
It's the same page, you go to Tools and you will see this link upload coupon.

41
00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:05.640
Okay, so you click on this and basically what you do is you define to like this is your service, right.

42
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.450
Yes.

43
00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:08.670
This is a solution.

44
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.760
I go and I be my service.

45
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.750
For telling me is like, this is

46
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:27.360
My namespace, which is again a logical name. This is not something which is the incubation period and

47
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.280
If you create that we need to give that

48
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:37.290
We need to give the number and I'll come to that. So this is application. This is again where we are saying, we basically we are grouping say

49
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:55.290
All these services into a one functionality. Right. And that functionality is again the broad into a single namespace, or it could be multiple points nowadays depend are deployed into a single namespace and that is, again, we have to pick on

50
00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:12.750
And it's now we on Friday we uploaded this country when you config file for dev environment that's how it is showing me that today you have dev environment, which is available for the deployments and the way it is doing this.

51
00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:23.010
Is just just a question or answer. Can you go back. So the ad group represent like all my cluster IP deployment everything in that app group right that's what you said we have group.

52
00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:32.610
UM, YOU NOT EXACTLY RIGHT. SO clusters again at the service level right

53
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:34.110
So,

54
00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.270
August it an API is one application one

55
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.300
Application, but under Jeannie you might have multiple

56
00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:40.740
Aggregated yes

57
00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.640
So,

58
00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.940
And select all the services are

59
00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:50.820
Will be deployed in one namespace are good way to broaden are different names with

60
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:57.240
Okay. Okay, got it, got it, got it. So I have group is like these are the list of they are like a tag right for all related app.

61
00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:10.470
Exactly. And what it means. It's like you're, again, this is a clubbing right so in this group you're deploying all this, do you have a single config file for the coop config beauty. Yes.

62
00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:16.050
Right, maybe in future we can use it for the entire roll back and deploy that is the plan.

63
00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:21.120
That that that is more. Yeah, the data we can do that part.

64
00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:21.960
Okay.

65
00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.840
But I think that that for the

66
00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:41.670
Future yeah completely separate discussion for the way we came up to this point it right so on. We have defined the GMO file, which I will work with the con this Friday laboratory. So here we are defined. So this is

67
00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:57.630
Against like this is a spring for service right job is that as we are defined as a micro service, which is Maven and Google notice, tomorrow, we might have like a different sources, which is a

68
00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:08.850
Python or any other language. But then this might change, then we have to change things. But for now, we're just supporting a spring with Google.

69
00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:16.470
Images right yes and change. This is not a big deal, we can change it on the fly.

70
00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:18.990
No. For now, just spray Maven project.

71
00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:26.730
And this is what we have defined namespace and the prediction part this is application borders and number two you rap group that you see here.

72
00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:28.500
So this is

73
00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:37.290
Dave, feel free to ask questions. Okay. In a live interactive for you guys. Okay.

74
00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:38.190
Yeah.

75
00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:41.970
We also have like a Node JS and a Python app. So could we be

76
00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:43.320
Able to deploy to this.

77
00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:45.300
Yeah, everything we but again.

78
00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:51.600
If you have that requirement is just let us know the requirement, what it is. And we'll build it and we'll do that part.

79
00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:55.260
Yeah, you just need to let us know, work with

80
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.130
Work with a team and they will enable it. The only thing that will change here is I think we change.

81
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:14.730
One of these, these three parameters. So we may change to one parameter will be greater that part will figure it out. And we can share once you let us know your apartment.

82
00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:21.090
And God gave 1.8. This is again specific version. This is Jenkins URL.

83
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:35.130
Which is something we do a test. So it was your test cases are getting executed and all that, that have something that you have to provide because every service that you're deploying should have some some baseline testing.

84
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.640
Some, some kind of validation should have

85
00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.880
And this is a health check URL. If you have any

86
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:46.050
So this is information that we're looking from the dirt in

87
00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:50.400
This is a services so

88
00:09:51.600 --> 00:10:10.350
Again, like when we are applying communities to every application, there could be a load balancer, you have a note here figures we have different types of services you have so you can define those services here and define and actually identify what is

89
00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:19.590
What is a service. What is a gamble file name that is applicable to that service right and

90
00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:22.920
And again, these services are

91
00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:32.370
Open it is defined it. There's no code for us. We just defining the MLM defining the configuration, the coolant is created for us. We just need to

92
00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:37.620
Let the system know where or what the file name is

93
00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:48.660
This one, and we are always expecting these fine I'll come to the park. We all access putting these wise to be stored in the gift in a specific format.

94
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:57.180
This could be, I mean this, we just put the hash and you can move this. I mean, you can put the names like

95
00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:11.130
Again, you put select something different, like load balancer or you have an additional service and just let us know by default we are today we are supporting node for load balancer secret and country.

96
00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:12.690
We have ingress

97
00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.670
And egress or will add in

98
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:17.340
Your salad.

99
00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:21.300
So just to add guys have created one

100
00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:29.820
Slack channel. Okay, I've added all the members here. So going forward, we can use that for all our company communications. They've you all being directly

101
00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:30.690
Yeah.

102
00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:32.130
So this entire group is there.

103
00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:33.660
And

104
00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:38.580
And the way we have configured these services in

105
00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:41.250
In the

106
00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:48.120
Not good.

107
00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:51.930
You're not ready to go here.

108
00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:55.740
This is one application that we have been testing.

109
00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:57.210
Wow.

110
00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:03.180
So this is how the different

111
00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:07.470
Services and there's

112
00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:10.020
A

113
00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:12.600
Dependency like

114
00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:20.370
Load Balancer Northport dollar services department store. This is your primary

115
00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:28.650
The service level or the application level gamble file for in this case this is for the Eureka.

116
00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:32.730
And there's a one service deployment for that which is again.

117
00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.880
assumption here is this service is

118
00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.980
Is common not common like this service deployment.

119
00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:51.750
It's not specific to a namespace across all the name spaces for this application, right, and then you have environment specific

120
00:12:52.830 --> 00:13:09.870
Applications like you have country and we have secrets, which are again namespace namespace again now which is environment, right, which are environment specific in this case they are on defining the 30 days you're the specific. So when we go to say like, when we say deploy God

121
00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:25.890
What this is going to do is convert deploy a service that can deploy the not forgetting the auto is forces are going to play a note vote is going to deploy the config service and then application.

122
00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:36.060
So just to take a small pause here bundles are going to put this on the Slack channel this link. It's an important thing they've delayed you understood what is happening here.

123
00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.930
I'm awkward. Like, how does the enrollment good picked up.

124
00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:49.050
So what is happening in you see the directory name right key at service hyphen deployment happened configured right now. So every project will have one directory

125
00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.890
So in our Genie project. Also, we need to create that directory

126
00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:59.850
Because the VCs deployment will look for that directory. Okay, now once you open this directory. Can you open the directly

127
00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:06.300
Yeah. So now let's open up some specific

128
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:08.040
Tone you think

129
00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:08.820
So,

130
00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:14.910
Yeah. So for this kind. And so these are different services and now we're gonna go to service level.

131
00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:20.430
Yes. Now let's say we have over orchestrator API. Here the right or your notepad application, right.

132
00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:29.670
So most of the time you deploy cluster IP right Winchester IP. There is no environment specific changes it always remain same from a moment to environment right

133
00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:41.010
So it won't be in any and warm and folder, it will be outside. That means it is same across all the environmental proud right it is immutable know makes sense.

134
00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:50.790
Yeah, now you have something called as your config maps right you have something called as your Ingress controller right now they are Norman specific

135
00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:53.610
We will change because in guess

136
00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.830
Whose team changes right the lip, Dave.

137
00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:57.900
You're getting the

138
00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:00.510
Most URL changes right from environmental environment.

139
00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:10.620
So that will come into a dev you it kind of directory that we create in the workforce workspace. Sorry, the VR see as workflow right integrated dev workflow.

140
00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:17.760
Total we have no not like when you run the pipeline. You tell him this in my environment us

141
00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:29.460
The unity stage of production and then basically, it will pull out this these files and then run the deployment.

142
00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:32.340
Korea.

143
00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:42.600
See, earlier I have deployed it application with the North Pole, as my service type. Now I want to deploy it as a load balancer.

144
00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:53.220
What, what changes, we might need to do. I know it in communities. We have to delete the service. And then we have to create it again. Do you follow the same here or

145
00:15:54.570 --> 00:16:12.840
If you go to good question. So if you have delivered the note automated load balancer. I would not be able to to basically delete the node board, but I will deploy the load balancers, he will come here will change does not put to load balancer.

146
00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:23.520
Are talking about the load balancer IP right which really get to see only, not for a not put IP in the new see the get services or

147
00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:26.850
The question is,

148
00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:28.170
Will it get deleted.

149
00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:29.550
It to a lot

150
00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:34.140
I think today, it will not get deleted, because we will not have that

151
00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:41.430
That basically track of that change it like you change the service type itself.

152
00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:49.350
Even though you have changed here for to be just like a file change, right. We're not tracking inside the file. What is a change

153
00:16:50.610 --> 00:17:03.180
Right, so a lot how track technically the food chain. Or maybe it's a good, a good bond. So like we can we can put another option to like if something that you want to, but that's that's the one.

154
00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:11.070
Number, you should be able to identify right the node food is missing from the services. So I need to delete it. Right.

155
00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:12.750
Do you have. Do you have are

156
00:17:14.610 --> 00:17:20.310
So you have upgraded the building emirate I would not go and look for anything else which is outside of the builder file.

157
00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:28.800
Agreed. But in the build audience right in the builder determine if I let's replace the known port with the load balancer right

158
00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:32.970
Yeah. Oh, but you will not know what was the well known port right

159
00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:36.570
I am not looking at the previous version. I'm not trying to differentiate

160
00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:37.500
Yeah.

161
00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:46.380
Okay, it's a good one. They will come to think about that right let me know the Slack channel. Yeah.

162
00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.750
You look like this.

163
00:17:53.430 --> 00:18:06.540
The system will do it right. It has come on select Update this image URL dynamically okay that part. I think we do not go over it. So for every environment or you can also define

164
00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:08.880
Environment config file.

165
00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:19.530
So, no, I'm config file will be again applications specific in the sense in a key. I mean, I think we are, we are also i mean

166
00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:24.210
The start for us is there to select a I want to have

167
00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:41.730
To North in the like in Devon test and a lot of kids didn't like it stayed in prod right i want to allocate more memory in the higher environments. So those other configurations which will be

168
00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:55.530
Template eyes. Right. And they'll be stored in again applications, but no specific end config files in the same template as you as you have your manifest file.

169
00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:00.780
So, the system will first our system to do at least

170
00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:15.720
Two to 10 years it will make to the manifest file. First, it will read if you have any environment config file and it will do those parameters and it will update this num deployment manifest file.

171
00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:37.890
And the other thing. It will also update is the image URL that will come dynamically from the, from the artifact. We are the build process, it will update in a manifest file and it will use that to deploy. If you had some the link logging road. Let me show one of the one of the logging.

172
00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:42.630
Is the Omni working on this thing. The Skyline given it is

173
00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:43.080
Yes.

174
00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:50.100
So you know the right you work with her in the past it. How many she is the Lord only knows about Bangalore.

175
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:52.230
Okay.

176
00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:57.690
So this is our deployment log. Look, you look like these are the

177
00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:01.050
Particular printing this

178
00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:06.300
This is what is coming from the media will file.

179
00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:09.300
Are

180
00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:15.600
Pulling out looking at select these are the complete while the other service files but

181
00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:19.320
Can you bring this slide.

182
00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:20.010
Yeah.

183
00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:23.070
Yeah, let me also to the

184
00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:42.180
CIO, and this is execution awkward. Basically, in this case. The other reason we showing this is and the more deport again a lot of know the one challenge that we're running into, but we have we have done that.

185
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:47.340
I feel like you only had a problem with. They are not. They are not

186
00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.380
Code is not applicable in depth.

187
00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:52.710
You know they are doing this and

188
00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:55.410
The reason is because

189
00:20:56.190 --> 00:21:00.810
It's a private IP. They're actually all the machines. Now those are not roundtable IPS

190
00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:14.280
So, okay, I we have gone on to the bursa like what the problem or the new Dysport to be upgraded in the deployment manifest file. Okay. Only after service has been deployed.

191
00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:18.180
For the health check, and all

192
00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:19.170
Not have to

193
00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:21.240
Check.

194
00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:23.520
That

195
00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:28.320
Out service. The word if they're using node. But we weren't get that

196
00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.120
It won't work actually

197
00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:34.140
You won't need this product. So,

198
00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:41.070
No question it. We don't need it for the deck.

199
00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:47.580
Or we don't need it for the say Jeannie application so

200
00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:56.580
We are we are doing it for skyline for my him again on time to understand, right. So, like, is it not applicable to deck platform.

201
00:21:56.730 --> 00:22:08.970
So, so let's go follow a standard like you know output is not at all recommended actually is for the standard here to we really need to go with node port. And second thing is in the deck application stack right

202
00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:09.480
Uh huh.

203
00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:11.910
So all the worker nodes, right.

204
00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:14.880
Where they are greeted with a private IP in the private on it.

205
00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:15.510
You know,

206
00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:19.320
So even if you create a new food, right, it won't be accessible.

207
00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:22.410
So Dave, you getting my point. Right.

208
00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:25.380
Yeah, maybe they can access like you

209
00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:26.160
Proxy right

210
00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:28.080
Yeah, as a

211
00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.720
Portal. I guess they can access but

212
00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:31.650
Then they

213
00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:32.280
Probably

214
00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:36.810
Yeah, the recommended that their ports are limited. So, not to use notepad.

215
00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:43.320
Yeah, the first day. I mean, I also this phone texting, like they don't recommend Lord for

216
00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:51.180
But again, like putting this this architecture has to be in for that standard otherwise we'll

217
00:22:53.460 --> 00:23:01.470
Miss I'm in for that actually someone wants to you don't provide a note for deployment, then nobody will use don't put you getting what I'm saying.

218
00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:05.130
I'm not saying it's not that we're collecting today if

219
00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:11.820
It's a deck right let dirt, dirt, dirt recommendable don't support not

220
00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:14.400
Even known border into Cuban it is community level also

221
00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:20.430
It's not recommended to us, known for, because the VM is even if, let's say the VM star roundtable IPS right

222
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:27.480
They will keep changing the IP. So that's why it is not recommended and cluster i being present load balancer solves all the problems.

223
00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:33.150
So how does and how it passes architecture within this

224
00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:36.300
So if you see a good exit. Right. So what we'd love

225
00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:41.760
To know what I'm trying to figure out the should not pass the Architecture Review

226
00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:44.400
The arkadin the RV.

227
00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:46.230
Yeah, ideally, there was

228
00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:58.320
No idea. We really would. I don't know. They discuss at this fine grained level to Notepad or something, right. I'm sure they might not be talking right now that things are they talk at 5000 seats were okay PC for deck.

229
00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:04.920
Okay, so maybe they deserve to be called out of the military is not 100

230
00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:07.260
Yeah, it's not recommended. I think, let me

231
00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:16.260
Miss, we should not have the not supported. Can you talk to the Armenian conveyancer

232
00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:18.300
Okay, yeah.

233
00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:24.900
Yeah, sure, just tell her it's no point using Notepad on deck. Also, right, yeah.

234
00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:33.720
Okay, so this is a log, which is you will see the log all the details. What exactly is getting deployed picked up or not.

235
00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:47.850
Yeah, I mean, I'm making movies like since we are sowing the seeds of this given it is deployment. Let's make it right. Actually, someone wants to come with node board, let it get an approval or you want to know portrayed

236
00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:52.440
Yeah, that's what I'm seeing now, not the emerging. No, no, no, go up.

237
00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:57.210
Yeah. You see we got a good. Let's put it everything here actually

238
00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:05.490
So going forward, all the channels all the discussion, we can do it here only on this leg.

239
00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:09.990
We can do

240
00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.660
Yeah, that will be good for recording purposes. Also know

241
00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:23.430
So now that being done. Okay, so let's take the node pulled out. Right. So what we can do is we can start creating the deployments. Okay.

242
00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:26.490
We'll have to create a build out Yama

243
00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:28.590
That they can work with nothing. Yeah.

244
00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:34.590
It'll just need to hit some other thing. And once you have it right I'm

245
00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:37.860
Dave just reach out to

246
00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:42.420
Each

247
00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:52.290
And every shape right and they will pull into like either somebody else to help with the pipeline all that to get it done.

248
00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:55.020
And they will depart.

249
00:25:58.320 --> 00:25:58.650
Yeah.

250
00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:07.290
Yeah, I think that should be good. And we need support for know I called on the slide for the Node JS and by the navigation.

251
00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:15.360
Node. Yes. And the Python application. How are you deploying it today. Do you have a Docker file or do you have the

252
00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:16.080
Docker file.

253
00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:21.840
That's fine. And then we can talk about his trip. So this is not a quarter.

254
00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:39.660
Oh and one more thing, like the Jenkins, you are able to do all the builds of for us. Right. Do we need to go and configure the bank Jenkins jobs or it will be auto created

255
00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:40.560
Forward.

256
00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:43.890
The Jenkins will jobs to push the Docker image and everything.

257
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.780
You don't do anything on that.

258
00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:48.240
So it will do a docker image for us right

259
00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:49.350
Because it will do everything.

260
00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:55.530
So in that case it will just look for the Docker file in our folder, right, that

261
00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:59.280
Will just follow the doctor to do them but

262
00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:02.970
The Docker file sometime it needs some extra hours. Also, right.

263
00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:05.580
At this file that will be again in our directory only

264
00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:06.690
Should we do right

265
00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:12.630
So it will pick it up. Yep, perfect. So the NA where it will publish artifacts, we

266
00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:13.170
Are

267
00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:15.450
Okay, sounds awesome.

268
00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:17.670
David looks like a bland.

269
00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:19.560
Yeah, sure.

270
00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:21.960
Do documentation or something.

271
00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:26.220
It's an initial phase man, the baby is born.

272
00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:34.440
Good question for like maybe just tapped out slowly yes still studying at both and all that work in progress.

273
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:36.840
Maybe one without vaccination.

274
00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:51.720
So I put a link for like some of the duck one who started. So what the bill Yama file means and Allah will keep on updating on will put the link on the on the flag itself to the confluence page.

275
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:56.190
Okay. And could you actually have some example, you will fail. So

276
00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:01.410
This is the final example.

277
00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:02.760
The question.

278
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.280
Yeah. Many created this is I created actually

279
00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:08.250
Your code both accord with

280
00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:10.440
So yeah, the first project you

281
00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:14.070
Know your money went to the last week. So you have the next one.

282
00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:17.460
Okay, cool.

283
00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:25.740
So the delivery, not in a hurry. Right now, said there was a good standard right we need to work with this deployment team.

284
00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:27.900
And actually I

285
00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:29.190
Need to help them also. Right.

286
00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:30.300
We can force it.

287
00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:33.450
We can unfortunately want to say this is what was not supported.

288
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:39.060
We got the Moto moto things kind of published and quantity

289
00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:40.530
And

290
00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:47.190
So as a first thing that they have what I want you to do the human didn't have a word with your money right for 30 minutes

291
00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:53.250
Just to get her on board for the node food thing like thing. We don't want to support know board right

292
00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:54.450
Now,

293
00:28:54.810 --> 00:29:03.930
You're getting and just understand from her also how she is deploying and maybe tomorrow or tonight, your evening time. We can sit down and I know we are those deliverables like priority also right

294
00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:10.680
So you can spend some 30 minutes them and then we can sync up in the evening time right you

295
00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:12.210
Can we delete.

296
00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:16.140
All can do it all together. Right. It should be straightforward, it will work actually
