0,and i'll share the jira stories of packages mentioned in detail how sap does that because we actually played it with and then find found our own our own right.,0
55,because from what said. it feels like this information could be what could possibly be a useful information to show some trends on because,0
30,he might have better information about the tables and he also did mention that there a couple of interns in the team who are also who also asked for similar information because i guess they are also working on similar,0
31,right. this the consumption data.,0
32,he might have better information about the tables and he also did mention that there a couple of interns in the team who are also who also asked for similar information because i guess they are also working on similar,0
33,but since i have no i'm not owning that and i'm not logged on and so i don't know how they get updated and how much latest data they have right,0
35,this what is consumption item. right.,0
37,right. this the consumption data.,0
38,as he has enabled so relative like i don't know the tables exactly for that. but somehow. so let's say one of the requirements that i we keep on hearing great customer is complaing about the user so,0
27,but since i have no i'm not owning that and i'm not logged on and so i don't know how they get updated and how much latest data they have right,0
40,he might have better information about the tables and he also did mention that there a couple of interns in the team who are also who also asked for similar information because i guess they are also working on similar,0
42,right. yep.,0
43,they should be tracking to use the data or usage report.,0
44,but it's in a week or can the content will give that only the content and the deck will be almost similar,0
45,will know how sap is playing and will be able to relate things maybe from bulldog. it doesn't play with that data with that.,0
49,just to buy the user report us to know what i use this to for the future.,0
50,don't have to go that route to the state to see the data. right.,0
53,he might have better information about the tables and he also did mention that there a couple of interns in the team who are also who also asked for similar information because i guess they are also working on similar,0
54,right. yep.,0
41,but it's in a week or can the content will give that only the content and the deck will be almost similar,0
22,the actual use it files.,0
56,and i'm sure he's aware of. good for. and i'm walking in smb right now i can walk through the flow. whatever i understand have,0
21,they should be tracking to use the data or usage report.,0
1,which basically would give us information about how,0
8,but it's in a week or can the content will give that only the content and the deck will be almost similar,0
3,will know how sap is playing and will be able to relate things maybe from bulldog. it doesn't play with that data with that.,0
4,just to buy the user report us to know what i use this to for the future.,0
10,this particular since have a won't have any customer names and uses that are simple. don't have to do another collection also right,0
9,but the quantity is different.,1
7,we are in. we have to derive what is actually happening. i'll share the link of the story.,1
6,need to fetch the bits from bits need to fetch the set. this one part,1
5,they'll apply that in the final doc will be there.,1
20,exactly. yeah. so if there's any other way.,1
48,if this something that can actually be shown as trained or something that can be just summed up and shown in a better way than that will be useful for,1
51,so need to rely whatever files are giving,1
52,rember over his logic. what is what,1
2,i don't do this one. it's just for us a desire to achieve this much to,1
46,second is basically a simple question from customers. i'm not sure my users are correct on my bill is correct. can please confirm,1
47,we don't even care about whether they're sending because it's not a mandate to do it constructs.,1
39,they'll apply that in the final doc will be there.,1
12,according to a time and some of the users quantity. right. yeah. and then calculate the differential quantity. right.,1
23,where in the comment have some comic value. i'm not seeing any,1
24,or i mean this is valid for a billing company.,1
25,somewhere if're forming those monitoring dashboards or whatever're,1
26,r user is submitted with a date or a priority or subscription started. so we are rejecting as a part of business.,1
19,lovely subscription might also be giving the data.,1
18,they'll apply that in the final doc will be there.,1
11,have the data for this said last month this said reported as much quantity this monitor about is quantity that discrepancy or the threshold is broken by this and might be a problem like this on.,1
29,r user is submitted with a date or a priority or subscription started. so we are rejecting as a part of business.,1
16,we don't even care about whether they're sending because it's not a mandate to do it constructs.,1
15,second is basically a simple question from customers. i'm not sure my users are correct on my bill is correct. can please confirm,1
14,rember over his logic. what is what,1
34,so need to rely whatever files are giving,1
13,when the fire comes to us right now maybe,1
36,they'll apply that in the final doc will be there.,1
17,i think those were my questions.,1
28,we are in. we have to derive what is actually happening. i'll share the link of the story.,1
