Text,
 Starting off recording,
 Right.,
 Yeah, this is cool. So I'm interested to see how this would work on my part. So now you got the pie chart, which shows who spoke the most,
 Or just the,
 Yeah, so this this person's spoke,
 And then the sentiment analysis is very that right,
 So I think this is the transcript that critique said it was like argument or something. So it was just,
 From looking from the sentiment maybe,
 These two are the ones that are arguing because they have some negative. I don't know.,
 Right. And so here's the story that I'm thinking that you can tell with yours is like,
 Say, say you missed a meeting and you just want. They just want to see what was discussed in that meeting high level overview, who is talking right so maybe like you can see like,
 Okay, if my manager was talking a lot in this meeting. Maybe it was important. Maybe I should go back and see what was discussed. I'm just trying to come up with a story that you can use.,
 Okay, then the word cloud will give you just a quick overview of the things that came up during this meeting. Right, so I definitely try to filter out the names,
 Yeah, just you want to. Yeah.,
 Cool. And then you got to sentiment below that we go down to something,
 So this is so blue is what is the colors lose positive green is neutral, red is,
 And this is something that over time throughout the meeting.,
 That's cool. And then we have the transcript below that. Right.,
 Cool you clean that up.,
 Yeah.,
 And so, and this is we're called to use as like meeting highlights right,
 Yeah.,
 Yeah, no, that's fine.,
 Cool.,
 So this looks like it's coming together then,
 So what I want to try to do is find a better transcript that you could use to demo with,
 See if I have any,
 Have any meeting setters.,
 Sorry Friday.,
 Okay.,
 I'll try to find a better transcripts for you to use for the demo, I think this one's,
 A little more challenging to follow.,
 But that was,
 Was there anything else that we were talking about adding to this.,
 Um, I think we talked about a little bit of like any are kind of like extraction,
 I can try out shoot,
 Yeah.,
 There's something I've been thinking about maybe you guys are more familiar says like training like spaces like in your model on like the domain of, like, maybe like software engineering. So like extracting firms like um,
 I don't know.,
 Quarter frameworks are using. So, and compiling a list of Python whatever technical terms. Maybe that's helpful. I'm not too sure.,
 Yeah. Um, yeah, go ahead and try it spacey is they have some pretty big models to actually download the large version.,
 So feel free to try it out. What do you think Nima over i.,
 Feel like that's a good idea. Overall I think I like it a lot. Um, the only thing that was like a little confusing to me when I first saw it was like in the sentiment profile. I always thought like the green bar represented like positive sentiment and I feel like,
 That always confused me,
 But I feel like other than that, I think it looks really good.,
 I can taste the color. Yeah.,
 Yeah, the green bar got me as well.,
 Have a good point.,
 I feel like it makes more sense to have the neutral be blue, like in my mind.,
 But, yeah, yeah.,
 If you could do like a stoplight so reds negative yellows neutral greens positive,
 Yeah.,
 Yeah, I think.,
 We should,
 We should,
 I was gonna say we should record a meeting and,
 This like optimize the meeting for like simplicity and like ease of the model following it, like, like we should have like the sentiments be like super clear,
 Like to like,
 To just like getting to this like super an argument.,
 Like just talking about how happy they are the entire,
 Meeting, he was being ridiculously unreasonable.,
 She's very difficult to work with.,
 Are you need to check yourself.,
 Yeah.,
 Yeah.,
 I like Williams idea you want to write a script.,
 Feel like I'd be curious to see if it actually like picks up on like, you know, the argument or things like that.,
 Well, I did you say some negative thing so,
 And we can have the transcript after this meeting, so I'll send it to me and we'll see what happens.,
 Nima is unreasonable will come on top of his word.,
 Oh, that's cool. I think this is looking good. Um, was there anything else that particular mentioning on this to add in. I don't remember.,
 I do have another,
 Transcript that somebody recorded for me.,
 One second. Okay. Yeah, I'll email him after this call.,
 Somebody does have another transcript that everyone a verse groaning Scrum calls, but I can't download it wasn't my meeting.,
 So I'll be interested to see what that looks like. Would it be possible to get this to download into a PDF or,
 Like the ass for the,
 Yeah okay yeah probably should be like a pre built thing.,
 Right. Yeah. Yeah.,
 Or just yeah i think i think you could just do some formatting on it. Other than that, it looks good.,
 Okay, yeah, I can look into that. So don't,
 Don't worry about PDF, but just try to get it formatted a little bit more,
 Yeah.,
 There's a wide right now.,
 Yeah yeah,
 Cool. I think that's all I have.,
 And also, I'm not sure if you guys saw the email from our CEO. So it's like your internship is getting short,
 But the good news is it's in,
 Those,
 Giving the entire company to day off. On September 4 and I think that was your guys's last day.,
 Oh, gotcha.,
 Do you guys get that, you know,,
 I don't know what I don't think I noticed it mean did you,
 I didn't notice it.,
 When it came from some guy named Pat gelsinger,
 He's a CEO. I don't know.,
 What,
 Oh wait on. Yeah, I see it now. Is it epic today off. Yeah.,
 I just saw Pat and I was like okay this is like an email from the CEO. So it probably doesn't like probably not like important just like some boilerplate.,
 Like there's no way. There's actually an effect me personally.,
 Yeah.,
 So, similar to a company holiday in June. This is a full day off for every VMware employee and intern.,
 So,,
 Yeah, it's kind of sad that it's your last day on event.,
 Yeah, so it's good to end your internship a day. Are we still get paid for it.,
 Yeah.,
 You probably wouldn't have had any work to do that. Anyways,,
 Yeah.,
 Remember the last day of my VMware internship that was,
 Trying to get my code running on a server that was sitting on my desk like in a panic.,
 But I got it got it deployed.,
 Mean we should make up for the Miss day bye bye busy after coronavirus we should,
 Oh, actually, I was gonna ask her, you'd like to say from the fire zone.,
 No, it's like writing like ashes here. So there's no like ashes like flying down and is like,,
 Still smoking ashes, like a hot or is it just like,
 Numbers. Yeah.,
 No, I had some emory's falling into my backyard. A couple of days ago.,
 Stressful.,
 It is,
 Back you,
 Know I'm about 3000 feet outside the evacuation zone. Oh my.,
 God so I'm good.,
 It's just like the hill that's behind my house is on fire.,
 Oh my gosh.,
 Seems,
 Safe. Yeah.,
 But mean is in Santa Cruz and I know they're,
 On fire all over the place.,
 Yeah.,
 We might need to evacuate at some point. I'm not too sure.,
 Yes, stay safe. I mean, that stuff comes first. If you need to leave just,
 Leave. Don't worry about the,
 Work stash.,
 Not kidding. Like, I know I took it seriously if you need to.,
 For, you know, just be safe. That's what's important.,
 There's no fires in San Diego right now. Right.,
 Don't think so yeah like I'm pretty sure it is not actually like,
 Either good,
 You guys that are in,
 Miami Beach are all good.,
 Yeah, no.,
 See her or,
 Miami or wherever, but,
 Yeah, I'm, I'm a bit far from Miami, but I I'm more in like the like Central Florida area so,
 Cape Canaveral like an hour outside Orlando basically,
 Got it, got it.,
 Yeah.,
 Sounds fun.,
 Are you seriously like only 3000 feet outside evacuations,
 It's not very far from it. But what it is is because the evacuation zone is pretty much just the hill behind me and anybody that's not in the hill is pretty much outside the evacuation zones. So I'm not in the hill make 3000 feet from the hell.,
 I think it's fine. But we'll see.,
 These things,
 I got my,
 Passport and social security card packed up,
 It's fine.,
 Cool. Um, I'll send you this transcript and I'm gonna try to I'm gonna,
 send another one as well from one of my colleagues.,
 And yeah, let it, let us know how it goes in the screenshot of how it looks.,
 And via the transcript that or the summary that comes out of it, too.,
 Serious. Yeah.,
 Cool. Anything else anybody wanted to add,
 Sounds good. Alright. Have a good weekend, guys. See you next week.,
 See,
 You guys,
